# 75 Hard Challenge Tracker

This repository contains an application designed to help you track your progress through the 75 Hard Challenge.

## What is 75 Hard?

75 Hard is a mental toughness program designed by Andy Frisella. It's not a fitness program, but a "transformative mental toughness program" that requires strict adherence to five critical rules for 75 consecutive days. If you miss any one of the tasks, you must start over from Day 1.

### The 5 Critical Rules:

1.  **Follow a Diet:** No cheat meals and no alcohol. The diet should be structured for your goals.
2.  **Drink a Gallon of Water:** Consume one gallon (approximately 3.78 liters) of water daily.
3.  **Complete Two 45-Minute Workouts:** One workout must be outdoors, regardless of weather conditions.
4.  **Read 10 Pages of a Non-Fiction Book:** Books must be non-fiction and self-improvement focused. Audiobooks do not count.
5.  **Take a Progress Picture:** Take a picture of yourself every single day.
